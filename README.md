# Exquisite Flickr

A small application to build some collages from flickr searches.

This uses the [phpFlickr class](http://phpflickr.com/) and [jQuery](http://jquery.com)

## How it works

* Calls to flickr for a photo search based on tags.

* Then gets the photo size by photo id.

* Then chops em up.

There are plans to make this fancier and prettier.

## It is SLOW

Flickr's api is slow, this code isn't fast.
